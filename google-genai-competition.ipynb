The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events. \n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":135},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now the preprocessed papers are transformed into vector embeddings.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def batch(iterable, n=100):\n    for i in range(0, len(iterable), n):\n        yield iterable[i:i + n]\n\n# Example usage:\npapers_embedded = []  # Your list of inputs to embed\npapers_batches = list(batch(preprocessed_papers, 100))\n\nfor batch in papers_batches:\n    batch_embedded = client.models.embed_content(\n        model='models/text-embedding-004',\n        contents=batch,\n        config=types.EmbedContentConfig(task_type='SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY'))\n    list_batch_embedded = [e.values for e in batch_embedded.embeddings]\n    papers_embedded+=list_batch_embedded\n\nprint(\"SUCCESSFULLY EMBEDDED \"+ str(len(papers_embedded)) + \" PAPERS\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T22:06:20.094847Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T22:06:20.095317Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T22:06:21.427479Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T22:06:20.095268Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T22:06:21.426475Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"SUCCESSFULLY EMBEDDED 100 PAPERS\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":138},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Once the vector embeddings of the papers are computed, these are stored into the chromadb database.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import chromadb\nfrom chromadb import Documents, EmbeddingFunction, Embeddings\ndef batch(iterable, batch_size):\n    for i in range(0, len(iterable), batch_size):\n        yield iterable[i:i + batch_size]\n\n\n# Start ChromaDB client\nchromadb_client = chromadb.Client()\n\n# Create or get a collection\ncollection = chromadb_client.get_or_create_collection(name=\"papers\")\n\n# Add the documents + embeddings to Chroma\nemb_batches = list(batch(papers_embedded, 41000))\npapers_batches = list(batch(preprocessed_papers, 41000))\nfor i in range(len(emb_batches)):\n    ids_batch = [f\"doc_{j + i * 41000}\" for j in range(len(emb_batches[i]))]\n    collection.add(\n        documents=papers_batches[i],\n        embeddings=emb_batches[i],\n        ids=ids_batch,\n    )\nprint(\"SUCCESSFULLY UPLOADED \"+ str(len(papers_embedded)) + \" PAPERS\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T22:06:25.455655Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T22:06:25.455972Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T22:06:25.559450Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T22:06:25.455947Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T22:06:25.558115Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"SUCCESSFULLY UPLOADED 100 PAPERS\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":139},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Vector database search example","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query_input = \"Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables.

It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated. \n\nID: doc_39\nPAPER TITLE: Multilinear function series in conditionally free probability with   amalgamation\nPAPER CONTENT:   As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion of conditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced by positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an analogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means of multilinear function series. \n\nID: doc_21\nPAPER TITLE: Stochastic Lie group integrators\nPAPER CONTENT:   We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes. Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes. \n\nID: doc_46\nPAPER TITLE: Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:   Part I\nPAPER CONTENT:   The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.   The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by the acoustic emission method. \n\nID: doc_85\nPAPER TITLE: Clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas\nPAPER CONTENT:   We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\\to \\infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":146},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## GENAI AGENT\nNow an AI agent is created where an LLM interacts with the user input and searches through the papers database to answer the scientific-paper related question.
